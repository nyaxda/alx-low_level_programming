# 0x14. C - Bit manipulation
The following are the learning objectives:
-   How to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators

The following are files in the directory and  here is what they do:
1. 0-binary_to_uint.c - function that converts a binary number to an `unsigned int`.
2. 1-print_binary.c - function that prints the binary representation of a number.
3. 2-get_bit.c - function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.
4. 3-set_bit.c - function that sets the value of a bit to `1` at a given index.
5. 4-clear_bit.c - function that sets the value of a bit to `0` at a given index.
6. 5-flip_bits.c - function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.
