# 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops
The following were the learning objectives:
-   What are nested loops and how to use them
-   What is a function and how do you use functions
-   What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
-   What is a prototype
-   Scope of variables
-   What are the  `gcc`  flags  `-Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89`
-   What are header files and how to to use them with  `#include`

The following are files found in the directory and what they do:
1. 0-putchar.c - program that prints `_putchar`, followed by a new line.
2. 1-alphabet.c - function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
3. 2-print_alphabet_x10.c - function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
4. 3-islower.c - function that checks for lowercase character.
5. 4-isalpha.c - function that checks for alphabetic character.
6. 5-sign.c - function that prints the sign of a number.
7. 6-abs.c - function that computes the absolute value of an integer.
8. 7-print_last_digit.c - function that prints the last digit of a number.
9. 8-24_hours.c - function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.
10. 9-times_table.c - function that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.
11. 10-add.c - function that adds two integers and returns the result.
12. 11-print_to_98.c - function that prints all natural numbers from `n` to `98`, followed by a new line.
