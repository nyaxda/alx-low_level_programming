# 0x12. C - Singly linked lists
The following are the learning objectives:
-   When and why using linked lists vs arrays
-   How to build and use linked lists

The following are files in the directory and  here is what they do:
1. 0-print_list.c - function that prints all the elements of a `list_t` list.
2. 1-list_len.c - function that returns the number of elements in a linked `list_t` list.
3. 2-add_node.c - function that adds a new node at the beginning of a `list_t` list.
4. 3-add_node_end.c - function that adds a new node at the end of a `list_t` list.
5. 4-free_list.c - function that frees a `list_t` list.
6. 100-first.c - function that prints `You're beat! and yet, you must allow,\nI bore my house upon my back!\n` before the `main` function is executed.
7. 101-hello_holberton.asm - 64-bit program in assembly that prints `Hello, Holberton`, followed by a new line.
