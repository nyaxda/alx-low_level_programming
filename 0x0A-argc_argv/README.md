# 0x0A. C - argc, argv
The following were the learning objectives:
-   How to use arguments passed to your program
-   What are two prototypes of  `main`  that you know of, and in which case do you use one or the other
-   How to use  `__attribute__((unused))`  or  `(void)`  to compile functions with unused variables or parameters

The following are files found in the directory and  here is what they do:
1.  0-whatsmyname.c - program that prints its name, followed by a new line. If you rename the program, it will print the new name, without having to compile it again.
2. 1-args.c - program that prints the number of arguments passed into it.
3. 2-args.c - program that prints all arguments it receives.
4. 3-mul.c - program that multiplies two numbers.
5. 4-add.c - program that adds positive numbers.
