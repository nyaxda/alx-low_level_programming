# 0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings
The following were the learning objectives:
- What are pointers and how to use them
-   What are arrays and how to use them
-   What are the differences between pointers and arrays
-   How to use strings and how to manipulate them
-   Scope of variables

The following are files found in the directory and  here is what they do:
1. 0-memset.c - function that fills memory with a constant byte.
2. 1-memcpy.c - function that copies memory area.
3. 2-strchr.c - function that locates a character in a string.
4. 3-strspn.c - function that gets the length of a prefix substring.
5. 4-strpbrk.c - function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes.
6. 5-strstr.c - function that locates a substring.
7. 7-print_chessboard.c - function that prints the chessboard.
8. 8-print_diagsums.c - function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers.
9. 100-set_string.c - function that sets the value of a pointer to a char.
