# 0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops
The following were the learning objectives:
-   What are nested loops and how to use them
-   What is a function and how do you use functions
-   What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
-   What is a prototype
-   Scope of variables
-   What are the  `gcc`  flags  `-Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89`
-   What are header files and how to to use them with  `#include`

The following are files found in the directory and  here is what they do:
1. 0-isupper.c - a function that checks for uppercase character.
2. 1-isdigit.c - a function that checks for a digit (`0` through `9`).
3. 2-mul.c - a function that multiplies two integers.
4. 3-print_numbers.c - a function that prints the numbers, from `0` to `9`, followed by a new line.
5. 4-print_most_numbers.c - a function that prints the numbers, from `0` to `9`, followed by a new line, but does not print `2` and `4`.
6. 5-more_numbers.c - a function that prints 10 times the numbers, from `0` to `14`, followed by a new line.
7. 6-print_line.c - a function that draws a straight line in the terminal.
8. 7-print_diagonal.c - a function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.
9. 8-print_square.c - a function that prints a square, followed by a new line.
10. 9-fizz_buzz.c - program that prints the numbers from `1` to `100`, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print `Fizz` instead of the number and for the multiples of five print `Buzz`. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print `FizzBuzz`.
11. 10-print_triangle.c - a function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line.
