# 0x03. C - Debugging
The following were the learning objectives:
-   What is debugging
-   What are some methods of debugging manually
-   How to read the error messages

The following are files found in the directory and  here is what they do:
1. 0-main.c - This file test that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0.
2. 1-main.c - I've commented out the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.
3. 2-largest_number.c - function that prints the largest of three integers.
4. 3-print_remaining_days.c - fixed the function that the output works correctly for _all_ dates and _all_ leap years.
5. main.h - header file
