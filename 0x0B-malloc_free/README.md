# 0x0B. C - malloc, free
The following were the learning objectives:
-   What is the difference between automatic and dynamic allocation
-   What is  `malloc`  and  `free`  and how to use them
-   Why and when use  `malloc`
-   How to use  `valgrind`  to check for memory leak

The following are files found in the directory and  here is what they do:
1.  0-create_array.c - function that creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char.
2. 1-strdup.c - function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter.
3. 2-str_concat.c - function that concatenates two strings.
4. 3-alloc_grid.c - function that returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers.
5. 4-free_grid.c - function that frees a 2 dimensional grid previously created by your `alloc_grid` function.
6. 100-argstostr.c - function that concatenates all the arguments of your program.
7. 101-strtow.c - function that splits a string into words.
