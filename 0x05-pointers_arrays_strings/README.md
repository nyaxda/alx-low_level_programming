# 0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings
The following were the learning objectives:
-   What are pointers and how to use them
-   What are arrays and how to use them
-   What are the differences between pointers and arrays
-   How to use strings and how to manipulate them
-   Scope of variables

The following are files found in the directory and  here is what they do:
1. 0-reset_to_98.c - function that takes a pointer to an `int` as parameter and updates the value it points to to `98`.
2. 1-swap.c - function that swaps the values of two integers.
3. 2-strlen.c - function that returns the length of a string.
4. 3-puts.c - function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to `stdout`.
5. 4-print_rev.c - function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.
6. 5-rev_string.c - function that reverses a string.
7. 6-puts2.c - function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.
9. 7-puts_half.c - function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line.
10. 8-print_array.c - function that prints `n` elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.
11. 9-strcpy.c - function that copies the string pointed to by `src`, including the terminating null byte (`\0`), to the buffer pointed to by `dest`.
