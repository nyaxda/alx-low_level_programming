# 0x06. C - More pointers, arrays and strings
The following were the learning objectives:
- What are pointers and how to use them
-   What are arrays and how to use them
-   What are the differences between pointers and arrays
-   How to use strings and how to manipulate them
-   Scope of variables

The following are files found in the directory and  here is what they do:
1. 0-strcat.c - function that concatenates two strings.
2. 1-strncat.c - function that concatenates two strings except that:
-   it will use at most  `n`  bytes from  `src`; and
-   `src`  does not need to be null-terminated if it contains  `n`  or more bytes
3. 2-strncpy.c - function that copies a string.
4. 3-strcmp.c - function that compares two strings.
5. 4-rev_array.c - function that reverses the content of an array of integers.
6. 5-string_toupper.c - function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.
7. 6-cap_string.c - function that capitalizes all words of a string.
8. 7-leet.c - function that encodes a string into [1337](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/9v9KfpvWnL0GoMu5mozbug "1337").
10. 100-rot13.c - function that encodes a string using [rot13](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/YRxmNA7BnP6yZhl09TKX3A "rot13").
