-   How to use the  `if`,  `if ... else`  statements
-   How to use comments
-   How to declare variables of types  `char`,  `int`,  `unsigned int`
-   How to assign values to variables
-   How to print the values of variables of type  `char`,  `int`,  `unsigned int`  with  `printf`
-   How to use the  `while`  loop
-   How to use variables with the  `while`  loop
-   How to print variables using  `printf`
-   What is the  `ASCII`  character set

## Files in the Directory:

1.  0-positive_or_negative.c - This program assigns a random number to the variable n each time it is executed.  It then prints whether the number stored in the variable `n` is positive or negative.
2. 1-last_digit.c - This program will assign a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed. It then prints the last digit of the number stored in the variable `n`.
3. 2-print_alphabet.c - This program prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
4. 3-print_alphabets.c - This program prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.
5. 4-print_alphabt.c - This program prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
6. 5-print_numbers.c - This program prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0`, followed by a new line.
7. 6-print_numberz.c - This program prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0`, followed by a new line.
8. 7-print_tebahpla.c - This program prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.
9. 8-print_base16.c - This program prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.
10. 9-print_comb.c - This program prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.
