# 0x17. C - Doubly linked lists

The following were the learning objectives:
-   What is a doubly linked list
-   How to use doubly linked lists
-   Understand and know how to implement the various operations (deletion, insertion, etc) with doubly linked lists
-   Start to look for the right source of information without too much help

The following are the files and their respective functions in this repository:
1. 0-print_dlistint.c - function that prints all the elements of a `dlistint_t` list.
2. 1-dlistint_len.c - function that returns the number of elements in a linked `dlistint_t` list.
3. 2-add_dnodeint.c - function that adds a new node at the beginning of a `dlistint_t` list.
4. 3-add_dnodeint_end.c - function that adds a new node at the end of a `dlistint_t` list.
5. 4-free_dlistint.c - function that frees a `dlistint_t` list.
6. 5-get_dnodeint.c - function that returns the nth node of a `dlistint_t` linked list.
7. 6-sum_dlistint.c - function that returns the sum of all the data (n) of a `dlistint_t` linked list.
8. 7-insert_dnodeint.c - function that inserts a new node at a given position.
9. 8-delete_dnodeint.c - function that deletes the node at index `index` of a `dlistint_t` linked list.
10. 102-result -  file containing the exact result of the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
