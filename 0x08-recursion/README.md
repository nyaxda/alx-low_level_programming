# 0x08. C - Recursion
The following were the learning objectives:
-   What is recursion
-   How to implement recursion
-   In what situations you should implement recursion
-   In what situations you shouldnâ€™t implement recursion

The following are files found in the directory and  here is what they do:
1. 0-puts_recursion.c - function that prints a string, followed by a new line.
2. 1-print_rev_recursion.c - function that prints a string in reverse.
3. 2-strlen_recursion.c - function that returns the length of a string.
4. 3-factorial.c - function that returns the factorial of a given number.
5. 4-pow_recursion.c - function that returns the value of `x` raised to the power of `y`.
6. 5-sqrt_recursion.c - function that returns the natural square root of a number.
7. 6-is_prime_number.c - function that returns `1` if the input integer is a [prime number](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/bjG_8Gu-_0rwbYA_tAv2Yw "prime number"), otherwise return `0`.
8. 100-is_palindrome.c - function that returns `1` if a string is a palindrome and `0` if not.
9. 101-wildcmp.c - function that compares two strings and returns `1` if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise return `0`.
