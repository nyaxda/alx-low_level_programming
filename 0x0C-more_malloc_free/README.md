# 0x0C. C - More malloc, free
The following were the learning objectives:
-   How to use the  `exit`  function
-   What are the functions  `calloc`  and  `realloc`  from the standard library and how to use them

The following are files found in the directory and  here is what they do:
1. 0-malloc_checked.c - function that allocates memory using `malloc`.
2. 1-string_nconcat.c - function that concatenates two strings.
3. 2-calloc.c - function that allocates memory for an array, using `malloc`.
4. 3-array_range.c - function that creates an array of integers.
5. 100-realloc.c - function that reallocates a memory block using `malloc` and `free`
6. 101-mul.c - program that multiplies two positive numbers.
